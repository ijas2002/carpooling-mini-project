This project revolves around a ride-sharing mobile application developed using Flutter.
I followed Egon Castle's playlist and incorporated additional pages for my convenience.
To use this code, you must create two Flutter projects under the same organization: 1) user and 2) driver.
When creating the Flutter projects, start with a basic template. Subsequently, replace your lib folder with my user lib folder for the user project, and do the same for the driver project.
Additionally, you need to add dependencies as specified in the pub file that I have provided.
